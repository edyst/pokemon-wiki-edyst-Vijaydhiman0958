      <h2>What are Pocket Monsters?</h2>
      <p>
        Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and
        published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as part of the Pokémon
        media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken
        Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy,
        and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred
        as the &quot;core series&quot; by their developers

        <h4>Water</h4>
        <p>
          Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and
          Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a
          simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
          Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based
          on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

          Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water and
          Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a
          simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
          Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so
          choosing the Fire variation starter is often a plus.

          simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new
          players.Grass is one of the weakest types statistically, with 5
          defensive weaknesses and 7 types that are resistant to Grass moves.

        <h3>Statistics of weight loss</h3>
        <p>
          The AR game&#39;s potential for weight loss was a big part of that
          discussion. In the process of getting out their doors and visiting
          parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of
          themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that
          he&#39;d lost 65 pounds between July and December.

          breaking records like fastest to earn $100 million and
          most-downloaded in its first month of release. To date, it has
          grossed almost $2 billion in revenue and been downloaded 800 million
          times. Although no longer the global phenomenon it was in 2016, the
          game remains incredibly popular.

      <p>
        &quot;Greninja is the final evolution of Pokémon X and Y water-type
        starter Froakie. It has the ability to take on an appearance
        resembling its trainer. Pokedex says: Greninja creates throwing stars
        out of compressed water. When it spins them and throws them at high
        speed, these stars can split metal in two.&quot;

      <p>
        &quot;Lucario is a bipedal, wolf-like Pokémon with blue, cream, and
        black fur. It is considered to be prideful and loyal to its trainer.
        Pokedex says: By catching the aura emanating from others, Lucario can
        read their thoughts and movements.&quot;

      <p>
        &quot;Mimikyu caused quite a stir for its peculiar looks and sad
        backstory when it was originally announced for Pokémon Sun and Moon in
        2016. Mimikyu is described as a Pokémon who felt so lonely that it
        decided to wear a rag in order to look like Pikachu, everyone’s
        favorite Pokémon. Pokedex says: Its actual appearance is unknown. A
        scholar who saw what was under its rag was overwhelmed by terror and
        died from the shock.&quot;

        &quot;Charizard is an orange draconic Pokémon who has a fiery temper.
        It is the final evolution of Charmander, one of the starter Pokémon
        for the original game. Pokedex says: Charizard flies around the sky in
        search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that
        it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any
        opponent weaker than itself. &quot;

      <p>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</p>
      <ol>
        <li>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</li>
    </b>
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>
        We&#39;re sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it
        quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every trainer,
        but you should also be well versed in the rodent&#39;s evolutionary
        chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also
        capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you&#39;ve
        bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all
        Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Answer is Raichu</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b>
      <li>What&#39;s the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</li>
    </b>

    <ul type="circle">
      <li>
        <p>
          Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There&#39;s the basic model you
          start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if
          you&#39;re looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon
          who emerge in later routes. If you&#39;ve made your way through any
          Pokemon game, you&#39;ve reached the point where you&#39;re presented
          with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot
          catch, and no button mashing at all is required.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>

        <h3>Type chart, effectiveness and weakness explained in Pokémon Go</h3>
        <p>
          Pokémon battles appear in most forms of Pokémon media, being the central
          gameplay aspect of the core series games, as well as being a constant
          focus of the anime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pokémon Go&#39;s Types are exactly the same as those in the main Pokémon
          games, but the effect of those type matchups is slightly different: in
          brief, things like effective or resisted attacks have slightly different
          multipliers to the main Pokémon games - although a December 2018 update
          brought them slightly closer in line.
